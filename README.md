# Introduction to Binary Numbers  

## What Are Binary Numbers?  
Binary numbers use only two digits, **0** and **1**, to represent values. This system is the foundation of all digital systems, including computers.

## Why Binary?  
- **Efficient Storage**: Computers store data as binary.  
- **Simplicity**: Binary logic (on/off) aligns with hardware design.

## Example  
The binary number `101` represents the decimal number **5**. Here's how:  
- \( 1 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5 \)
