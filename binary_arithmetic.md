# Binary Arithmetic  

## Binary Addition  
Rules for binary addition:  
- \( 0 + 0 = 0 \)  
- \( 0 + 1 = 1 \)  
- \( 1 + 1 = 10 \) (carry the 1)  

---

### Example  
Add \( 101 \) and \( 11 \):  

| Binary  |    |    |    |    |
|---------|----|----|----|----|
| \( 101 \) | +  | \( 011 \) |    |    |
|         | =  | \( 1000 \) |    |    |

## Binary Multiplication  
Rules for binary multiplication:  
- \( 0 \times 0 = 0 \)  
- \( 0 \times 1 = 0 \)  
- \( 1 \times 1 = 1 \)  

Example: Multiply \( 101 \) by \( 10 \).  
Result: \( 1010 \)
